# B-Dot Proportional controller
--- 
This is a B-dot propoertional controller which is used in satellite Detumbling and gets triggered post 15 mins 
of ejection of the satellite from the P-Pod of the launch vehicle.

3 SS-430FR ferromagnetic troque rods exert magnetic torque based on the B-dot magnetic control law on all 3 princpal 
axes of inertia there by controlling angular velocity. 

This controller takes into account all the ferromagnetic properties as well as the actual rod dimensions into account.

A reduction from 30 rad/s to 2 rad/s is achieved.
